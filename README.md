# PLCTraffic-Light-Control-of-my-course-project Simens PLC 1200-V7 TIA
This is not a huge project, just my course design. I don't want to delete it directly. Thus I choose to share and upload it to GitHub.
Without much expectaion of being discovering but if anyone can fine this. That will be a fortune destiny.

Briefly construction, Just download the zip documents on the list, then unfold it. In this zip you can see two documents,
just choose which one you favorite and use it. But I highly recomend to unfold the zip named Traffic_Light_Control_System.
Because it's a pure one without my name.

Tips: You should download TIA first as the whole project is made of it.
Simulate the code and HMI simultaneously. After that you will come cross what's going to happen with this code.
